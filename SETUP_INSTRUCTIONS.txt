HOW TO DEPLOY:
	Make sure you have Java and Maven installed!
	If you want to run different Java versions, be sure to set your %JAVA_HOME% and %PATH% variables accordingly.
	When doing so, make sure the <maven.compiler.source/> and <maven.compiler.target/> elements in the pom.xml are set accordingly.
	(Note: Earlier Java versions may give errors if incompatible with certain XXE fixes)

	To run test cases out of the command line:

		- Run mvnTestReport.bat or mvnTestReport.sh

	To run test cases out of a web browser:

		- Run mvnDeployWebApp.bat or mvnDeployWebApp.sh
		- When it gets to "[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...", open the UnitTestsWebApp URL shortcut (or navigate to http://localhost:8080/java-security-unit-tests)
		- Press Ctrl-C in the command line when done and then terminate the batch job

	To run test cases with Contrast:

		- Place your contrast.jar file in the base directory (security-unit-tests)
		- Run mvnDeployWebAppWithContrast.bat or mvnDeployWebAppWithContrast.sh
		- When it gets to "[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...", open the UnitTestsWebApp URL shortcut (or navigate to http://localhost:8080/java-security-unit-tests)
		- You should see the app running in Contrast
		- Press Ctrl-C in the command line when done and then terminate the batch job

	NOTE: The custom jar files in the lib folder remove the META-INF/services folder that the respective libraries use to override classes that exist in other test cases.

HOW TO RUN ALL TESTS AUTOMATICALLY:
	Make sure you have Python installed and in your path!

	- Download ChromeDriver at https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
	- Place the executable in the project base directory (or add it to your path manually)
	- Deploy the web app
	- Run RunAllTests.bat or RunAllTests.sh
